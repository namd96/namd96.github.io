            &nbsp; (2019)<br />
            The intent behind this project was to provide a platform to sell and buy services and products in Mumbai.
            This plarform in being made to be suitable for small home industries to sell their products. Also the
            services like domestic help, salon can be offerred on platform. There are no technical restrictions as to
            what kind of
            services can be offered on this platform. Although, super admins can restrict them as per their business
            logic.
            This is still an academic project so there is no branding done yet and I have kept the styling and
            appearance to very minimalistic.

        <h2 style="text-align: center">Current Scope :</h2>
        <p>
            • Auth : Login and register :
            There are three types of user logins -
            <br /> 1. Customer : Customers can login, register, logout, browse through products and services, search
            them, chat with vendor


            <br /> 2. Vendor : Vendors can associate their services to one of the services that are offered by this
            platform, add sub-services to those sevrices, add menus to the sub services, create products, chat with
            customers, make the services/sub services/menu items active and inactive
            <br /> 3. Super admin : Super admin can create the master list of services that can be offered on platform
            which vendors can associate their services with, they can add master categories for the products/services,
            etc. Basically, superadmin can take care of the master data management.

        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center">Future Scope :</h2>
        <p>
            <br />• Customer : Customers in the future can apply filters on the products, can send address cards,
            product/service cards through chat to vendor, track the orders they placed.
            <br />•Vendor : Vendors in the future can send menu cards, product/service cards through chat, add products,
            manage and track the received orders, etc

        <h2 style="text-align: center"> Technology :</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size : 18px;font-weight: 500">
            Codebase : <br />
            &nbsp; Front-end : ReactJS + hooks + context api + webpack + react-bootstrap <br />
            &nbsp; back-end : nodeJS + expressJS + JWT + sql
        </p>
        <h2> Reusable Components: </h2>
        <p>
            * Front-end :
            <br /> &nbsp; 1. Login
            <br /> &nbsp; 2. Sign Up
            <br /> &nbsp; 3. Product cards for mobile view
            <br /> &nbsp; 4. Chat component
            <br /> &nbsp; 5. Smart search input box :
            This search input box hits the request only when the user stops typing. The waiting duration is passed
            through props.
            <br /> &nbsp; 6. Toolbar


        </p>
        <h2> Services: </h2>
        * Front-end : <br />

        <br /> 1. Agent : This module consists of the configurable API call function. This function can be called from
        wherever
        this module is imported by passing the parameters like request name(ex. post, get,etc ), endpoint , body, and a
        Boolean for the loader display. This function then returns the response body asynchronously after some
        conventional error handling.
        <br /> 2. Node server : This server sends build file of the server side rendered project as a response.
        <br />3. Backend node server : This is a typical backend server enabling client to communicate with the database
        and handle other jobs such as JWT, email sending, etc.
        Authenticator service authenticates the users , creates and decodes JWT to maintain login sessions.
        Validator Service validates users using policies that I defined. This is mainly to define permissions for user
        roles.
