        </p>
        <h2> Services: </h2>
        <br /> 1. Agent : This module consists of the configurable API call function. This function can be called from
        wherever
        this module is imported by passing the parameters like request name(ex. post, get,etc ), endpoint , body, and a
        Boolean for the loader display. This function then returns the response body asynchronously after some
        conventional error handling.
        <br /> 2. Node server : This server sends build file of the server side rendered project as a response if the
        request
        is made from browser. If the request is made from crawler bots , the server redirects those requests to the
        project which is server side rendered so that they can access meta information in purposes of SEO.
        <br />3. SSR project : This is a server side rendered project running on a port that the node server directs
        crawler
        bot requests to. This project only throws the meta information to those bots for SEO purposes as they can’t be
        accessed in server side rendered (SPA) project.
        <h2>Standard features developed:</h2>

            <h3> • Landing page with featured products, artists and categories:</h3>
            <img style="width : 10%" src="landing-page.png" /><br />
            Landing page consists of various components : Artists sections, Artworks sections, Blog section, etc.
            The section components are rendered by passing the props like:<br />
            <br /> 1. Title of the section
            <br /> 2. Description of the section
            <br /> 3. Keyword for View All Button to redirect the user to the list page
            <br /> 4. isColored: If the background color is white this prop is false
            <br /> 5. data: the array of the JSON objects for the respective cards.<br />
            Since the project requirement was to keep this page very dynamic, the sections were made very customizable,
            reusable and maintainable. Dynamicity is maintained using props.<br />

            <h3>Profile Creation</h3>
            1. Fetching profile pictures using graph APIs of facebook and Google in case of social logins <br />
            1. Uploading profile picture image manually with the same work flow as artwork image upload. <br />

            <h2> Product CRUD with image crop and resize UI </h2>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Actions from user :</span>
            <br /> 1. Select an image file from the local memory storage. (Or click a picture from the camera if on
            mobile phone.)
            <br /> 2. Crop the image as required.
            <br /> 3. Fill up the form and press upload.<br />
            <img style="width : 10%" src="upload-crop.PNG" />
            <img style="width : 10%" src="upload-artwork.png" /><br />

            <br /> <span style="font-weight: bold">Processings done on image :</span>
            <br /> 1. Validation checks on the cropped image for minimum height and width as per business logic.
            Rejection of the respective image if not matched the criteria.
            <br /> 2. In case the cropped image is larger than the maximum limits, resize it to maximum limits
            maintaining the aspect ratio.
            <br /> 3. Multiple image upload is possible. the code structure allows to change the maximum upload limit by
            changing the value of variable max_upload.
            <br /> 4. The artwork profile is created using only the first image along with the form data which returns
            the artwork id and the other images are attached to that artwork id to avoid the risks of losing any data.
            <h2>Extra responsibilities:</h2>
            <h3>
                Semi automated deployments including build, nginx configuration, small node service for CSR/SSR
                switching.

            <h2> Examples of implementation approach : </h2>
            <!-- a. Filter component: Standard checkboxes and dynamic component rendered in filter taken as a prop. -->
            a. Filter component: <br/>
            The filter component is configured using an array of the of the JSON objects passed as props if the filters
            are to be rendered as checkboxes like shown in the above picture.

            <br />To configure the custom filters like pricing and size, functional object returning the required html
            can be pushed to the configuration array passed as a prop to filter component.<br />

            <img style="width : 10%" src="searched-artworks-filters-3.png" /><br />
            The filter component returns the array of JSON objects with the key value pairs of selected filters to the
            parent component.
            
            <br /> b. SSR based on requesting client being a crawler otherwise CSR-SPA
            <br /> c. Responsive design in the entire project   <br />
